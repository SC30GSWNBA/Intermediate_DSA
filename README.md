# Intermediate_DSA
Basics of Data Structures with Python

Hello All,

I created this respository for myself as a revision exercise. Hope it helps others who have some/limited/zero knowledge of Intermediate Data Structures. Feel free to have a look around. All the notebooks uploaded could be executed in Colab/Jupyter. Comments/Suggestions are most welcome.

P.S: This is not a tutorial and contains snippets/basic concepts of Intermediate DSA. I have included all the important ones.

Thanks,
